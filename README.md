This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android applications using the Expo CLI. The problem stems from the inability to locate or execute the `gradlew` command, a crucial component of the Android build process. This can occur for various reasons, including incorrect environment variable settings, missing SDK components, or insufficient permissions.  The solution provides a comprehensive approach to address this problem, focusing on environment setup, SDK verification, and permission checks.
